title: "Getting Started with GitHub Pages and Jekyll"
---

My fairly inactive blog was previously hosted with Blogger,
which wasn't exactly easy for a non-webby person to modify.
I've decided to start using GitHub Pages with Jekyll instead,
as it will be easier to manage with a Git client, and will be
much easier for me to make incremental changes to the site as
I get to grips with there approach.

[GitHub Pages][1] has just upgraded to [Jekyll 3.2][2]
with the option of simple themes. I'll start out with that,
and move on to creating my own theme at some point in the future.

## Migrating
There aren't many posts on my previous blog that I feel are worth
preserving, but I will move some of the posts over in the coming weeks.

## Going Forward
As always, I'll try to make use of this. I also intend to make some
kind of personal wiki where I can keep a couple of handy snippets.
Not entirely sure how I'd like to implement that, however,
but we'll see how it goes!
