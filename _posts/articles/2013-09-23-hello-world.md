As I am a programmer the standard introduction seemed appropriate.

Welcome to my little corner of cyberspace where I will be adding to the endless ocean that is, the internet.

The goal of this blog is to chronicle the progress through my honours project as part of the Games Development degree at Edinburgh Napier University.
I hope to make a regular weekly update on my progress, as well as share other information that may be interesting, and hopefully, related.

I have yet to firmly pin down what the aims of the project will be,
but it will essentially be a redevelopment of a simple games engine into a more robust, user-friendly games engine.
More will become clear as the weeks go on. In the meantime however, think Unity, but not nearly as good.

Feel free to share your thoughts on my future updates if you wish to contribute.
